## 🚀 Problem Overview

With the growth of online education, maintaining fairness during remote exams is difficult.  
Traditional systems lack real-time surveillance, making cheating easy through:

- Using secondary devices
- Getting outside help
- Leaving the environment unnoticed

Manual supervision is not scalable, inefficient, and error-prone. ObserveX solves this with AI-based proctoring automation.

## 🎯 Proposed Solution

ObserveX integrates:

✔ Real-time webcam monitoring  
✔ Object & activity detection  
✔ Automated warning & cancellation  
✔ Unified platform for students & teachers

**System Goals:**

- Ensure secure online exams
- Automate proctoring
- Reduce monitoring cost
- Centralize exam operations

---

## 📚 Background

Existing tools (Google Forms, LMS platforms) only handle question delivery and results.  
They lack:

❌ AI-based proctoring  
❌ Behavior detection  
❌ Automated intervention

ObserveX bridges this gap with integrated AI monitoring.
